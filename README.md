# Inventory Control System

Inventory control system website built with PHP, Apache, MySQL. Project developed for Software Engineering Lab in. college.


## Backend

Here the backend would be the apache server. That is taking in all the requests. PHP is used as the scripting language to dynamically display the content to the user as HTML web documents. 


## Server

This being a small scale intended inventory. We went for a database that has consistency and Availiblity. So, what is better than MySQL if we are on this edge of the CAP triangle.


## Frontend

SSR pages from the server with CSS styling.
